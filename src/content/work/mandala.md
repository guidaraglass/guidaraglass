I managed to grab some from <a href='https://www.instagram.com/thesproutedplate' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='App-link'><strong>@thesproutedplate</strong></a> a few months ago and finally made myself a cute decoration for my kitchen window. My son loves the refractions even more than I do! Swipe to the end for cute toddler laughs.

Let's just ignore the fingerprints I got all over it while taking pictures"

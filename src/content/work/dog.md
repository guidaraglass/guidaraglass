caption: "Not so fun fact: my dog Ozzie has been battling cancer for the past 6 years and today we found out he needs yet another surgery. I can't keep track of how many it's been at this point. He's a happy dog with a great quality of life so we'll do whatever it takes to help him live his best life. Dr. Finan at <a href='https://www.instagram.com/finananimalhospital' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='App-link'><strong>@finananimalhospital</strong></a> has taken such great care of him and it means the world to us.

In an effort to cover his latest vet bills, I'm offering pet portrait commissions. See how cute Mia is? Your pet will be too!
